== Transaction flow

The high-level steps in the Starknet transaction lifecycle are as follows:

. *Transaction submission:* A transaction is submitted to one of the gateways, functioning as the Mempool and marks the transaction status as `RECEIVED`.

. *Mempool validation:*
The mempool performs a preliminary validation on the transaction. If the transaction is invalid, it does not proceed.

. *Sequencer validation:* The sequencer performs validation on the transaction before executing it to ensure that the transaction is still valid. If the transaction is invalid, it does not proceed.

. *Execution:* The sequencer operation sequentially applies all validated transactions to the state. If a transaction fails during execution, it is included in the block with the status `REVERTED`.

. *Proof generation:* The Prover executes the operating system on the new block, computes the proof, and transmits it to L1.

#What about verification? Is that not considered part of the transaction lifecycle?#

[id="transaction_status"]
== Transaction status

The diagram below illustrates how each transaction status fits into the overall transaction flow:

image::txn-flow.png[]


The following are the possible statuses of a transaction from the moment it's sent by the user to the moment it's validated by L1:

=== Finality statuses

[id="not_received"]
==== NOT_RECEIVED

The transaction is not yet known to the sequencer.

[id="received"]
==== RECEIVED

The transaction was received by the mempool. The transaction now either executes successfully, is rejected or reverted.

[id="accepted_on_l2"]
==== ACCEPTED_ON_L2

The transaction passed validation and entered an actual created block on L2.

[id="accepted_on_l1"]
==== ACCEPTED_ON_L1

The transaction was accepted on Ethereum.

=== Execution statuses

[id="rejected"]
==== REJECTED

The transaction was received by the Mempool but failed validation in the sequencer. Such transactions are not included in a block.

[id="reverted"]
==== REVERTED

The transaction passed validation but failed during execution in the sequencer. It is be included in the block with the status `REVERTED`.

[id="succeeded"]
==== SUCCEEDED

The transaction was successfully executed by the sequencer.

[id="transaction-state-implications"]
== State Implications of a `REVERTED` Transaction

When a transaction is marked as `REVERTED`, the following state implications occur:

Nonce increases:: The nonce value for the account of the failed transaction iterates despite the failure.

Fee charge:: A fee is charged for the execution of the transaction up to the point of failure.

Partial Reversion:: All changes that occurred during the `validate` stage are not reverted. However, all changes that occurred during the `execute` stage are reverted, including no messages to L1 or events.

Fee Calculation:: The fee charged for `REVERTED` transactions is calculated as follows:

[source,bash]
----
fee = Min(max_fee, consumed_resources)
----


Consumed Resources:: The `consumed_resources` are the resources used for the execution of the transaction up to the point of failure. This includes Cairo steps, builtins, syscalls, L1 messages, events, and state diffs during the `validate` and
`execute` stages.

[id="transaction_receipt"]
== Transaction receipt

The transaction receipt contains:

* Basic transaction details (block identifiers and the index within the block).
* A summary of the execution resources used by the transaction.
* The events emitted .
* A list of messages sent to L1.
* A consumed L1 message (in case the transaction invokes an L1 handler).


The following is an example of a receipt:
