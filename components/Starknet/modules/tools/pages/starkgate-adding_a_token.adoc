= Adding a token to StarkGate

You can implement a new token bridge in the following ways:

* Use the `enrollTokenBridge` API. You can use a block explorer or a CLI.

For information, see xref:starkgate_dev_reference.adoc#enrollTokenBridge[`enrollTokenBridge`] in the StarkGate API reference.

* Write a token bridge and contact StarkWare to add it to StarkGate.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `enrollTokenBridge` API adds a token bridge with standardized functionality to the StarkGate Registry. If you want to write a token bridge with non-standard functionality, make sure to implement the `isServicingToken` API.

For more information, see xref:starkgate_dev_reference.adoc#isServicingToken[`isServicingToken`] in the StarkGate API reference.
